My ideas for project are 

1.To make a lost and found app for college 
where anyone could update any lost item and help others find such items.
2.To make a memoir app for us and our alumni where all can share current 
and past photos/memories related to our college.
3. An update to the current sembreaker app wherein students can share resources
if they would like to do so thereby making the content updated regularly.
